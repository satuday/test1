Roof gardens have existed since ancient times. Beyond just being aesthetically pleasing, roof gardens have practical benefits, too. Some environmental benefits of roof gardens include the following: </p>
<ul>
<li>
Thermal insulation (warms in winter and cools in summer)</li>
<li>Noise insulation</li>
<li>Wildlife habitats</li>
<li>Rainwater detention</li>
<li>Reduced air pollution (plants help trap particulates and gaseous emissions)</li>
</ul>
<p>The following are some of the important criteria to consider before designing a roof garden:</p>
<ol>
<li>Roof characteristics/structure (it’s easier to design and construct a building with a roof garden in mind than to add a roof garden to an existing building, although that can also be done in many cases)</li>
<li>Cost (will the benefits and overall savings outweigh the initial cost?)</li>
<li>Climate (temperature, overall sun and shade exposure, wind, and so on)</li>
<li>Design (how simple or elaborate will it be?)</li>
<li>Purpose (is it just for residents to enjoy, or will guest tours be offered?)</li>
<li>Maintenance (what is involved, what is the cost, who will take care of it?) </li>
</ol>
<p>
Roof gardens are becoming more popular as urban development depletes the few remaining green areas of many cities. Countless cities throughout the U.S. and around the world, in a variety of climates, are exploring the benefits of rooftop gardens. In both office and residential buildings, prospective tenants seem to consider roof gardens a worthwhile feature.
One of the most elaborate examples of a roof garden is The Kensington Roof Gardens in London, England. It actually consists of three gardens: the Spanish Garden, the Woodland Garden, and the Tudor Garden. The gardens take up over one and a half acres and have a view of London’s skyline. Events, such as weddings, are held at the gardens frequently. A restaurant is also on the roof, plus a members’ club that is open on Friday and Saturday nights.

 After the last frost in your area, the soil should be warm enough to plant tomatoes. Choose a spot where the plants will receive at least six hours of sunlight each day. Due to the clay soil found in most of the South, it is recommended that you augment the soil with some peat moss or humus. You have the right mix if it crumbles when you squeeze a handful.
 </p>
<p>
Be sure to dig a deep hole for the tomato plant. It should sit deeper in the ground than it does in the pot. This helps the roots grow stronger and produces a stronger plant. Add a little fertilizer to the soil before planting. Tomato plants can get very large and need extra support, so it is best to use stakes or a cage to hold them up so they won't fall over.
</p>
<p>
Water the plants well when you plant them, and then check them regularly to see if they need more water (wilted leaves are a sign that they need water). When you water, focus on the soil around the plant rather than watering the plant itself. Consider adding fertilizer after another six to eight weeks.
</p>
By following these tips, you should be able to enjoy a fruitful tomato season.
